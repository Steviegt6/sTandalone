TODO List:

	!Massive multiplayer MMR boss desyncs due to desynced server/client mod bool values.
*Master Mode Reloaded:
	-Additional AI for all of the Vanilla Bosses (Mutant)
		^Especially Golem, huge pushover, even in Expert
	-Additional Weapons from each boss
	-Non-boss enemy AI changes (Mutant)
	-New debuffs from enemies/bosses/biomes (Mutant)
		^Possibly accessories to combat said debuffs
	-Preventative measures to stop any cheese attempts of bosses
	-General balance changes to the mode as a whole
	-Playtesting of the mode (whenever we get a majority of this stuff finished)
*General:
	-Allowing loading of .png files instead of .xnb files (pbone)
	-New MenuMode when you are reinitializing your client (Stevie)
	-Allowing modded NPCs/Items/etc to be added more easily
	-QoL changes that haven't already been implemented (if any, don't have any on mind atm)
	-Resource pack support (not sure if possible due to tmod patcher)
	-Make "Host & Play" button run the modded TerrariaServer.exe, not the vanilla one
		^Either that, or prevent modded players from joining vanilla servers (or both)

	-Discord Rich Presence compatability
	?Repo cleanup (lots of files from the TML repo that can be removed, i think)
